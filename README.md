Magneto 2 Module for Bullseye Locations Service [www.bullseyelocations.com](http://www.bullseyelocations.com/)

This extension provides some native Magento features for Bullseye Location cloud service. Bullseye is an elegant and flexible store locator software solution that integrates with any website. By using a cloud based (or SaaS) solution it provides more flexibility and greater number of features than extensions that include the locator code, db and features inside of a native plugin.  This results in a solutions with less features than a cloud service such as the bullseye Locator, plus leads to maintenance issues you don't have with a software as a service based locator.
